Version 0.1.1
=========================

* fix a warning/note that appears due to cran-checks. Actually I followed roxygen2 documentation about the imports, however the R-cmd-check of cran complains, so a uneccessary import was added to the rd-files.

Version 0.1.0
=========================

* initial release
* classical linear models and GLMs can be tested
  out of the box
* interfaces defined and documented in order to
  reuse the resampling schemes for other models
